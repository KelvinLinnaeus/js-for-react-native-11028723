## Student ID: 11028723

This repository contains JavaScript files for manipulating arrays.

## Files:

1. **arrayManipulation.js**: Contains functions for manipulating arrays.
   - `processArray`: Takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where even numbers are squared and odd numbers are tripled.
   - `formatArrayStrings`: Takes two arrays, one of strings and one of numbers, and modifies each string based on its corresponding number (capitalizes if even, converts to lowercase if odd).

2. **userInfo.js**: Contains a function for creating user profiles.
   - `createUserProfiles`: Takes an array of original names and an array of modified names, and returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1.

## Usage:

To use these functions in your project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the desired function(s) into your JavaScript file.
3. Call the function(s) with appropriate arguments.
